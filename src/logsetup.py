    A logging Formatter that displays timestamps as MM:SS.cs using local time.

        Formats the log record's creation time into MM:SS.cs format.

        Uses `time.localtime` to convert the record's creation timestamp and
        formats it as minutes, seconds, and centiseconds. The `datefmt` argument
        provided by the base class is ignored in this custom implementation.

        Args:
